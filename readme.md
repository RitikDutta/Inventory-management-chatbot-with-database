# Inventory management chatbot
Our inventory management chatbot is designed to help businesses and individuals keep track of their inventory in a simple and efficient way. The chatbot allows users to input and store data about their inventory items, including item names, quantities, and location. This information is saved on a Flask server that we have created and made available on GitHub.

With our chatbot, users can easily access and update their inventory data at any time, allowing them to quickly and accurately manage their inventory. The chatbot also has the ability to provide alerts and notifications when inventory levels are low or if there are any discrepancies in the data.

In addition to its convenient and user-friendly interface, our inventory management chatbot also offers secure storage of data on the Flask server. This ensures that users' inventory information is protected and accessible only to authorized users.

Overall, our inventory management chatbot is a valuable tool for businesses and individuals looking to improve their inventory management processes and keep track of their inventory in a simple and efficient way.
